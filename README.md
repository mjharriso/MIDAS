DESCRIPTION
===========

 MIDAS (MIDAS Iso-surface Data Analysis Software)
 is a Python package primarily for processing
 gridded data stored in CF-compliant NetCDF/HDF5 format
 (http://cfconventions.org). 

 A handful of functions have been employed as class methods.
 For example: spatial interpolation between quadrilateral meshes using 
 the FMS code developed at NOAA/GFDL; temporal interpolation between calendar
 dates (datetime); conservative re-mapping in the vertical dimension using
 MOM6/ALE developed at Princeton and NOAA/GFDL; spatial
 integration in one to three cartesian directions, e.g. 'X','XY' or 'XYZ'; 
 and temporal averaging (Datetime).
 
 
 MIDAS (Modular Isosurface Data Analysis System) was first developed by 
 Matthew Harrison 2011-2012 as an employee of NOAA in the 
 GFDL Oceans and Sea Ice Processes Group.

CONDA INSTALL
=============



	STRONGLY RECOMMEND Anaconda 
	
	conda install -c matthewharrison midas=1.2
	
        IMPORTANT - You also need to be working in a compatible environment
	in order to satisfy dependencies with Fortran libraries. There is more
	than one way to skin this cat, but recommend the following:

	Requirements:
	- bash
	- already installed anaconda (https://anaconda.org) and it is in your path.
	
	
	1. Cut and paste the following into a custom environment MIDAS.yml configuration file:

	name: MIDAS
	dependencies:
	- python>=2.7.11
	- libgfortran=3.0.0
	- basemap=1.0.8.dev0
	- numpy=1.10.4
	- scipy=0.17.0
	- netcdf4=1.2.4
	- dateutil=2.4.1
	- midas=1.2

	2. Create the enviromnent:

	conda env create -f MIDAS.yml

	3. Activate the enviroment to use MIDAS scripts
	
	source activate MIDAS

	4. Deactivate MIDAS environment

	source deactivate

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

	There is a temporary workaround to a problem with a NetCDF shared library. Do this, in case you get
	an error complaining about missing libnetcdf.so.7 

	ln -s <your_conda_path>/lib/libnetcdf.so <your_conda_path>/lib/libnetcdf.so.7

	or if you have a problem with libmkl missing:

	conda install nomkl numpy scipy scikit-learn numexpr
	conda remove mkl mkl-service
	
	

EXAMPLES
========

	cd examples
	python contour_example.py # Fetches OpenDAP URL from NODC and plots with Matplotlib
	python hinterp_example.py # fms/horiz_interp does bi-linear interpolation from the original
	                          # 1-deg to a 5-deg grid with masking
	python hist.py            # volume-weighted histogram of salinity in the Indian Ocean
	python subtile.py         # use subtiling algorithm to calculate un-weighted
 		       		  # cell average bathymetry and roughness. Example along the Eastern US 

	
HOW TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTATION
===========================
	
	
	ipython
	>>> import midas.rectgrid as rectgrid
	>>> rectgrid.[Tab]   # complete listing of methods 
	>>> rectgrid.quadmesh       # a generic rectangular grid description
				    # Can be read from a file or provided as
				    # 2-d lat/lon position arrays.
	>>> rectgrid.state?  # Description of state instance
	>>> rectgrid.state.state.[Tab] # available methods for state objects
	>>> rectgrid.state.volume_integral?  # integrate scalars over the domain
				     # in 'X','Y','Z','XY' or 'XYZ'
	>>> rectgrid.state?? # View the code
